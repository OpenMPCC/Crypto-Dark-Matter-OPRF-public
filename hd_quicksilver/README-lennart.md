# Low-Bandwidth Mixed Arithmetic in VOLE-Based ZK from Low-Degree PRGs

This is the implementation of our paper

"Low-Bandwidth Mixed Arithmetic in VOLE-Based ZK from Low-Degree PRGs"
by *Amit Agarwal, Carsten Baum, Lennart Braun, and Peter Scholl*.
[Eurocrypt 2025](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2025/).
<!-- [ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/TODO). -->

The implementation is based on commit
[ca5d6b7](https://github.com/GaloisInc/swanky/commit/ca5d6b755abce97fb14713de699eb4217bcb0341) of
the swanky framework (which was the HEAD of the `dev` branch on 2024-01-17).
The original README.md of swanky can be found [here](README-swanky.md).



Our implementation is part of the [`diet-mac-and-cheese`](diet-mac-and-cheese/) crate.
We give an overview of our additions and modifications in the [here](diet-mac-and-cheese/src/README.md).

## Build and Test

The implementation was developed and tested under Linux on an x86-64 CPU with AVX2 and Rust 1.81.
To run the benchmarks the [`tc`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/tc.8) utility is required to simulate
different network settings, and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is used to analyse the
benchmark results.

The software expects a Git repository to be present.
So if you download the software as .tar.gz/.zip archive instead of cloning the Git repository,
please initialize a Git repository and create a dummy commit:
```shell
git init
git commit -m dummy --allow-empty
```


To build and execute all tests of swanky run
(or first change into the [`diet-mac-and-cheese/`](diet-mac-and-cheese/) subdirectory to only run the
corresponding subset of tests):
```shell
cargo test
```

To build the benchmarking application, run:
```shell
cargo build --release --example=bench
```


## Benchmarking and Analyzing the Data

### The `bench` Program

The benchmarks are implemented
[here](diet-mac-and-cheese/examples/bench.rs)
and you can run the benchmark program as follows:
```shell
cargo run --release --example=bench -- <subcommand> <options>
# or using the relative path to the binary (if already built)
./target/debug/examples/bench <subcommand> <options>
```
In the following examples, we will just write `bench` for brevity.

Use
```shell
bench help
# or
bench help <subcommand>
```
to get detailed usage information.
The two subcommands relevant for our benchmarks are `conv` and `fpm` for the conversion and
fixed-point multiplication benchmarks, respectively.
In the following we describe the most important options.

#### Common Options
- `--party <...>` which party to run
    - `prover` or `verifier` runs only the respective party and communicated to the other party via
      `TCP/IP`
    - `both` runs both parties in separate threads, communicating through a UNIX socket
- `--repetitions` how often the whole benchmark should be repeated
- `--json` if the output should be given in JSON instead of being human readable
- `--protocol <...>` select the protocol to use to verify the conversions/fixed-point multiplications
    - `edabits`: The protocol from BBMRS21 (CCS'21) our base line
    - `cheddabits-v1-tspa`: Our protocol with TSPA predicate and version 1 seed setup
    - `cheddabits-v2-tspa`: with TSPA predicate and version 2 seed setup
    - `cheddabits-v1-xor4maj7`: with Xor4Maj7 predicate and version 1 seed setup
    - `cheddabits-v2-xor4maj7`: with Xor4Maj7 predicate and version 2 seed setup

    (NB: version 1 and 2 does not make a difference for fixed-point multiplication)

#### Network Options
To connect to the other party (if not running `both` parties in the same process), use the following
set of options:
- `--listen` to listen for incoming connections
- `--host <HOST>` to set which address to listen on/to connect to (default: `localhost`)
- `--port <PORT>` to set which port to listen on/to connect to (default: `1337`)
- `--connect-timeout-seconds <SECONDS>` to set how long to try connecting before aborting (default: `100`)


#### `conv` Options
- ` --num <NUM>` how many conversions to verify
- ` --bit-size <BITS>` the size of each conversion

#### `fpm` Options
- ` --num <NUM>` how many fixed-point multiplications to verify
- ` --integer-size <BITS>` the bit-size of the integer part of a fixed-point number
- ` --fraction-size <BITS>` the bit-size of the fractional part of a fixed-point number


#### Example Output

```shell
# run in first terminal
bench conv --party prover --listen --protocol cheddabits-v1-xor4maj7 --num 4096 --bit-size 16 --repetitions 3
# run in second terminal
bench conv --party verifier --protocol cheddabits-v1-xor4maj7 --num 4096 --bit-size 16 --repetitions 3 --json
```

### Running Benchmarks

All scripts mentioned in this section are located in the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory.
To run benchmarks for a large set of parameters, we provide [`run_conv.sh`](scripts/run_conv.sh) and
[`run_fpm.sh`](scripts/run_fpm.sh).
In our case, we execute the benchmarks on the same physical server using the [`tc` (traffic
control)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/tc.8) utility to simulate different network settings.

The benchmark scripts use [`tc.sh`](scripts/tc.sh) to switch between the LAN/WAN settings.
Note that the parameters and the RTT and throughput measured with `ping` and `iperf3` can differ
slightly.
We used the latter to find the right tc parameters.
To use `tc` you need additional permissions, so make sure you are allowed to use `sudo`.
The scripts will ask you for your password.

To run the benchmarks, please make sure the `bench` binary is build (using `--release` mode as described above).
Then open two terminals, change into the [`scripts/`](scripts/) directory, and run:
```shell
./run_conv.sh prover    # in the first terminal
./run_conv.sh verifier  # in the second terminal
```
and similarly for `run_fpm.sh`.
The benchmark results will be printed to the screen and also saved in the
[`scripts/results/`](scripts/results/) subdirectory:
```
ls results/
conv__party=prover_protocol=cheddabits-v1-tspa__bit-size=16__num=1024__network=lan__time=2025-03-07T13:18:04,692669286+01:00.json
conv__party=prover_protocol=cheddabits-v1-tspa__bit-size=16__num=1024__network=wan__time=2025-03-07T15:40:01,233233066+01:00.json
conv__party=prover_protocol=cheddabits-v1-tspa__bit-size=16__num=256__network=lan__time=2025-03-07T13:17:42,070965340+01:00.json
...
```

### Analyzing Benchmark Results

Again we have two scripts `analyze_conv.py` and `anaylze_fpm.py` which use a somewhat recent version
of pandas (tested with v2.2.3) which aggregate the JSON files into pandas dataframes and print to
the terminal:
```shell
./analyze_conv.py results/
./analyze_fpm.py results/
```
Both scripts display a pandas dataframe to the terminal and store corresponding CSV files
(`res_conv.csv` and `res_fpm.csv`) in the passed directory.
